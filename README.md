## About Me

Hi! I'm Muhammad Hassan, an aspiring AI Engineer on a mission to master Artificial Intelligence and build a meaningful career in tech. I'm currently following a rigorous 160-day learning journey focused on Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Generative AI. This path includes hands-on projects, daily progress, and consistent skill development with the goal of becoming fully job-ready.

 **Current Focus**:
- Completing my AI learning roadmap (ending at Day 160)
- Building an AI portfolio on GitHub
- Preparing for remote internships, freelance roles, and entry-level AI jobs worldwide

 **My Goal**: To get hired within 2 weeks of completing this journey â€” using the skills, projects, and network Iâ€™ve built along the way.

I post daily about my progress in my linkedin account and also creating my portfolio in github

 Letâ€™s connect and grow together â€” whether you're in tech, hiring new talent, or learning AI too!
